# JAMSS ToDo List
-----------------

* including in header the (collapsable) most important remarks
* additional CSS design tunning of scan output
* fixing some issues with non-UTF8 files (detecting and converting to UTF8 before scan)
* implement a nicer user interface (probably borrowing styling from joomla admin template)
* add many additional patterns to scan for malware fingerprints - _any suggestions highly appreciated_
* add file+pattern whitelisting option
* line numbers instead of offset
* add timestamp scan of all files, for future submission
* make a Joomla! Core files scan (hash-based) to find any modifications of those - both malicious or core-hacks 
* build in a command line interface option (to let it run via Cronjob)
* make a full-blown Joomla! component based on this script
* other minor and major functions and improvements
