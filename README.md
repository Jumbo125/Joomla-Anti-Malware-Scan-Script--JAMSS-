### Joomla! Anti-Malware Scan Script (JAMSS)
***
The **_Joomla! Anti-Malware Scan Script_** is a self-service script that will be continually programmed to assist all Joomla! owners to check their Joomla! installation for various trojans and other web-malware. The script currently uses regex patterns to identify the most common fingerprints, traces and indices that some files have/could've be compromised.

This script still **doesn't do any cleanup on its own**, it's only informative about some suspicious code in your Joomla! installation.

This script is far from being 100% accurate. It has just a few patterns at this moment, and the false-positives are very well to be expected. So you may only use it wisely and with caution. I do not take any resposibility for any damages you might suffer by following some advices or results of this script.

#### Usage instructions
The usage is pretty simple and straightforward:

* upload two files (jamss-X.Y.Z.php and jamssPatterns.php) to the webroot of your hosting account
* open the scanner file in your browser using URL like this http://www.your-joomla-site.com/jamss-X.Y.Z.php
* the script will run for several seconds, maybe even minutes, depending on number of your files and load on your webserver

***

#### ToDo !!

* implement a nicer user interface
* add many additional patterns to scan for malware fingerprints - _any suggestions highly appreciated_
* make a Joomla! Core files scan (hash-based) to find any modifications of those - both malicious or core-hacks 
* build in a command line interface option (to let it run via Cronjob)
* make a full-blown Joomla! component based on this script
* other minor and major functions and improvements

#### Status
_BETA_ - This is a "**work in progress**" so let me know if you have any problems, found bug, have questions or wish to help in some way.
